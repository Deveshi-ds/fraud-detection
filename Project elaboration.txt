
 1. Data Cleaning Including Missing Values, Outliers, and Multi-collinearity

Data Cleaning Steps:
-Handling Missing Values:
The dataset was checked for missing values. The SimpleImputer with a median strategy was used to impute missing values in columns
like oldbalanceOrg, oldbalanceDest, newbalanceOrig, and newbalanceDest.

-Outlier Detection and Treatment:
Here, the Interquartile Range method was used in outlier detection and removal.
For each numerical column, outliers were detected by the IQR method, and rows containing these outliers were removed from the dataset.

-Dealing with Multicollinearity
The Variance Inflation Factor was calculated for numerical features. Features that report high values of VIF have multicollinearity.
 Remove those features iteratively until all features are at values of VIF below the threshold to reduce multicollinearity.

2.Fraud Detection Model in Elaboration
The fraud detection model applied is the XGBoost, which is one of the robust and efficient gradient boosting frameworks.
 The reasons for using XGBoost are its effectiveness with high-dimensional and large datasets and its sterling performance
 pertaining to classification tasks.

-Balancing using SMOTE:
Class imbalance in the dataset was dealt with using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.
 In this technique, synthetic examples of the minority class—fraudulent transactions—are generated so
  that the model is not biased towards the majority class, the non-fraudulent transactions.

-Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
The hyperparameters of the XGBoost were tuned using Optuna, an automated hyperparameter optimization framework.
This tuning vastly improved the model performance by finding the best hyperparameters.

3.Selecting Variables to be Included in the Model
-Variable Selection:
The variables were selected by domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis.
Some of the important features included amount, old balance of origin and destination accounts,
and new balance of origin and destination accounts.

The feature importance was checked through Random Forest, and the less important features were removed but all
relevant features were used because the VIF analysis didn't recommend any further removal upon adjustment.

4. Plotting the best set of tools to demonstrate model performance

-Classification Report:
The model performance was checked against test data using precision, recall, and the F1-score.
All these metrics provide insights into how well the model is doing on fraudulent transaction identification.

-ROC-AUC Score
Compute the ROC-AUC score to show the model performance in class differentiation. A high ROC-AUC score is a pointer to good model performance.

-Cross-Validation:
In order to make sure that model performance is consistent on various subsets of data,
the process of cross-validation needs to be applied to the entire pipeline. This would prove the model's robustness.

5. Key factors that predict fraudulent customer

-Transaction Amount: Large amounts or huge changes can be indicative of fraud.

-Old and New Balances at Origin and Destination: A sudden change in balance or zero balances after transaction could be indicative of fraud.
-Outliers in Balances: Extreme values in account balances often align with fraudulent transactions.



 6. Do These Factors Make Sense? 

 Yes, the Factors Make Sense:

-Amount of Transaction:
 Why it Makes Sense: Abnormally large transaction amounts or patterns that differ from a customer's regular spending behavior
  indicate that something is wrong and there's foul play. Also pertaining to this, since fraudsters are arbitraging
  as much as they can during this period, they tend to result in larger-than-usual transactions.
   Example: A sharp, large transaction that has no place in the customer's history could raise a red flag worth investigating.

-Difference Between Old Balance and New Balance of Origin and Destination Accounts:
 Why it Makes Sense: If big differences appear in the account balances (which turn `oldbalanceOrg` or `newbalanceOrig` suddenly to zero or negative`),
  such cases might indicate a fraudulent money transfer, as fraud perpetrators tend to transfer the funds to zero out or lay low the accounts.
    Example: An account that frequently ends up with a very low or zero balance post transaction may be laundering money
    or committing fraudulent transfers.

-Outliers in Balances:
 Why it Makes Sense: Extreme values of account balances, either very high or very low, could show that something is wrong with
  the way the account is being used. Such patterns are symptomatic of accounts being pass-throughs for illicit transactions.
    Example:Balances that are consistently high without high-value transactions to explain them might indicate an account that
    is used to aggregate before siphoning the funds.

-Consistency with Fraud Patterns:
   Why it Makes Sense: Found factors match known patterns of fraudulent behavior such as anomalies in transaction amounts
    and irregular changes in account balance.

These logically are indicators of fraud based on history and typical scenarios of fraud and thus helpful in detection of suspicious activity.

 7. Preventions to Be Adopted While the Company Upgrades the Infrastructure

Upgrading the infrastructure to enhance fraud detection and prevention includes :—

-Real-time transaction monitoring:
Implementation: Put into place real-time transaction analytical systems that will identify anomalies
 while they are occurring, providing flags accordingly.
   \Benefit: Be in a better position to immediately intervene in suspicious transactions and greatly reduce
    the likelihood that fraudulent transactions are processed.

-Enhanced Security Protocols
  Implementation: Utilize advanced encryption standards together with multi-factor authentication in
  safeguarding customer data, ensuring its integrity for customers, and ensuring safe transactions.
   Benefit: Reduces or minimizes access by unauthorized users, thus limiting exposure for fraudsters to
    easily make transactions that would be able to pass without detection.

-*Behavioral Analytics
   Implementation:Utilize machine learning models to discern and predict common user behavior.
    This would be instrumental in detecting deviations in behavior, which could culminate in fraud.
   Benefit:Dynamic during the detection of potential fraud paradigms as compared to static rules.

-Continuous Model Updates and Retraining
   Implementation: Regularly train the fraud detection model with new data to help enterprises keep pace with
    newly devised fraudulent tactics and methods.
   Benefit: The model is relevant and active against new form of fraud.

-User Education and Awareness:
   Implementation:Programs raising awareness for customers and employees regarding the identification and reporting of suspicious activities.
   Benefit: The stakeholders can identify and take action regarding a potential fraud, thereby supporting the technical measures.

8.Evaluation techniques to check whether They Are Effective or not

If an organization has already implemented the fraud prevention measures, then the evaluation of their effectiveness is important.
 The management can take the following steps and use the KPIs and metrics mentioned here:

-Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   Detection Rate: Monitor the percent of fraudulent transactions detected in comparison to pre-implementation levels.
   False Positives/Negatives: Monitor the false alarm rate and missed frauds in order to operate the system and
    upgrade the precision and recall of it.

-Post-Implementation Audits:
   Routine Review: There should be routine audits of flagged transactions for accuracy of the detection and for finding any gaps in detection.
   Feedback loops: Implement a mechanism of feeding the results of these audits back into the models for improved detection.

-User and Stakeholder Feedback:
   Surveys and Reports: Surveys and reports from users, both within and outside the organization,
   of their perception of the extent to which the new system is secure and effective.
   Customer Satisfaction: Indicators of changes in customer satisfaction and the level of trust post implementation of the new system.

-Comparison with Historical Data:
   Trending: The current rates and patterns of fraud detection should be compared with the information retrieved from
   historical data to observe any improvements that are noticeable.
   Anomaly Detection: Analyze if the system is able to capture
